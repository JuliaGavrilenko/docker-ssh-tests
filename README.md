# Docker CentOS 7 SSH server and SSH client
CentOS 7 containers that work as ssh-server and ssh-client or both, out of the box.

## Pre-requisites
1. 2 machines (let's call them **ssh_server_vm** and **ssh_client_vm**) with Docker > 18 installed (tested on Docker 18.06.1-ce)

## Instructions
1. Setup Docker Swarm
  1. On the ssh_server_vm, run
    1. ``` docker swarm init```
    This should print a join command for the worker in the form of
    ```docker swarm join --token <your-token> <your-ip-address>:2377```
  1. On the ssh_client_vm, run the join commanded generated in previous step
1. Clone this repository on both the machines
1. Setup an overlay network
  1. On the ssh_server_vm, from within the cloned repository's root directory
  ```./network_setup.sh```
1. Build ssh_server image and Start the ssh_server container 
  1. On the ssh_server_vm, run
  ```./ssh_server/run_ssh_server.sh```
1. Build ssh_client image and Start the ssh_client container
  1. On the ssh_client_vm, form the cloned repository's root directory, run
  ```./ssh_client/run_ssh_client.sh```
